## Explore Datasets
This notebook contains the filtering and retrieval of our data for our project. We attempted to get college stats but they are the same as the NBA stats so we abandoned ship.

Therefore only to cell 5 where `full_df.to_csv("./draft_stats.csv")` is relevant to the project's functionality. Otherwise, the data has been stored in a csv file for convience.
